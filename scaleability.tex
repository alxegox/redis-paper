\chapter{Partitioning}

Splitting redis into multiple instances is a process called partitioning. Every instance will only contain a small subset of the keys.

Partitioning servers two main goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Database can be much larger because using multiple computers merged into one is more powerfull than using a single instance.
\item Scaling becomes reality. Giving control over how much cores and isntances used in your cluster is a must for bigger systems.
\end{itemize}

\section{Types}
There are several ways to split up your keys and route your users to what they need.

\subsection{Range Partitioning}
\subsection{Hash Partitioning}
\subsection{Consistent Partitioning}
